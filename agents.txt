Building
AI agents are autonomous systems designed to perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with their environments in ways that mimic human-like intelligence.

The key tools for building AI agents include benchmarks (to evalutae performance), datasets (to help fine-tune/train), frameworks (to build/deploy), LLM models (as an operating system for agents - e.g. GPT4), Prompt engineering (e.g. Chain-of-Thought), Tools (to achieve tasks), and Workflows (e.g. through tools like zapier). Each of these have their own section to make it easier to browse/find these components, and this is a rapidly growing area of interest in the community.
